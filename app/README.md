# Angular Clicker App

## How to install 

Once the API is installed, to install the Angular App, you'll need to install the needed dependencies : 

```bash 
npm install
```

You'll then have to create a `env.ts` file to specify where your API will be running, and on what port. You can copy/paste `env.sample.ts` as an example.

## To run the app

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## To build the app

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
